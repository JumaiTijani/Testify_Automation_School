//You are to create 3 variables for a "square shape" class which will be "class A",
//shapeSides (number of sides of the shape), shape length and shape breadth.
//From your knowledge of encapsulation, create getters and setters for length and breadth variables and
//create only a getter for shape side(this is because we don't want anyone setting the sides of a square. the sides of the square must and always will be 4).
//Create another class "B", set the values of length and breadth.
//Get the value of the length and breadth and calculate the area.
//print out your final calculation like this.
//"The area of a square of length: {put the value of the length} and breadth {put the value of the breadth} is {put the value of the area u calculated}"
